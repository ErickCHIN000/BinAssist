    "description": "A plugin that provides LLM helpers to explain code and assist in RE.",
    "longdescription": "This is a LLM plugin aimed at enabling the use of local LLM's (ollama, text-generation-webui, lm-studio, etc) for assisting with binary exploration and reverse engineering. It supports any OpenAI v1-compatible API. Recommended models are LLaMA-based models such as llama3.1:8b, but others should work as well.\n\nCurrent features include:\n* Explain the current function - Works at all IL levels.\n* Explain the current instruction - Works at all IL levels.\n* General query - Query the LLM directly from the UI.\n* Propose actions - Provide a list of proposed actions to apply.\n* Function calling - Allow agent to call functions to navigate the binary, rename functions and variables.\n* RLHF dataset generation - To enable model fine tuning.\n* RAG augmentation - Supports adding contextual documents to refine query effectiveness.\n* Settings to modify API host, key, model name and max tokens.\n\nFuture Roadmap:\n* Agentic assistant - Use Autogen or similar framework for self-guided binary RE.\n* Model fine tuning - Leverage the RLHF dataset to fine tune the model.\n\n## Screenshot\n![Screenshot](/res/screenshots.gif)\n\n## Homepage\nhttps://github.com/jtang613/BinAssist",
